		<p class="more">

			This document and any other materials provided by CryptovationX Ltd or relating to the CryptovationX Platform do not constitute

		<p class="more">

			Do not participate in the Initial Coin Offering if you are not an expert in dealing with cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based
			software systems as well as contribution to smart contract systems. Contributions should be undertaken only by individuals,
			entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic
			tokens, like Bitcoin, Ether, and blockchain based software systems as well as contribution to smart contract systems.
			Contributors should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic
			tokens. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not participate in the Initial Coin Offering.

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more">

			Users must be made aware of certain risk factors, as set out in Section 5 (Risk Factors).

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more">

			Prior to contributing, you should carefully consider these Terms & Conditions and all other materials available concerning
			the CryptovationX Platform and CXA and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional.

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more">

			These Terms & Conditions govern the creation and allocation of CryptovationX cryptographic tokens (CXA) by CryptovationX
			Group Ltd. (CryptovationX), which has issued CXA by means of certain smart contract software codes operating on the Ethereum
			blockchain for that purpose (such codes, jointly, the Smart Contract System) and to which certain third-party individuals
			and entities (each, a User) have contributed during the initial offering of CXA (Initial Coin Offering).

		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			1. Initial Coin Offering Principles</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) CryptovationX is currently developing an automated advisory platform (the CryptovationX Platform) that is accessible
			to first-time users and addresses issues with existing exchanges, as described in the CryptovationX Platform Whitepaper
			(the Whitepaper). By transferring funds (Funds) in either bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) to the Smart Contract System pursuant
			to these Terms & Conditions in order to contribute to the development of the CryptovationX Platform (the Contribution),
			the User understands and accepts that his Contribution will be utilized to enable further development of the CryptovationX
			Platform (as determined in CryptovationX’s sole discretion). In addition to the Initial Coin Offering, CryptovationX shall
			also arrange a pre-sale against a guaranteed allocation of CXA (the Pre-sale) where Users are able to contribute Funds.
			These Terms & Conditions shall apply to such Pre-sale offerings, but may, at CryptovationX’s discretion, be amended accordingly.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) Further information on the CryptovationX Platform can be found in the Whitepaper and the Initial Coin Offering documentation
			available on the CryptovationX Platform website (https://cryptovationx.io). The information contained in the Whitepaper,
			the Initial Coin Offering documentation and on the CryptovationX Platform website are of a descriptive nature only, are
			not binding and do not form part of these Terms & Conditions.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			c.) Before being eligible to participate in the Initial Coin Offering, each User must register and undergo an identification
			(KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) process. The registration instructions and schedule are available on the CryptovationX
			Platform website. After registration is complete and approved, CryptovationX will whitelist the User’s address in the
			Smart Contract System, and the User may make a Contribution by transferring either BTC or ETH to the Smart Contract System
			within the Initial Coin Offering Period. The terms governing the funding process are set out in more1 detail in Section
			2.2.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			d.) The User understands and accepts that CryptovationX may in its sole discretion determine to accept contributions from
			private entities and individuals of strategic value for the CryptovationX Platform, and that such contributions may be
			accepted at terms that differ from these Terms & Conditions.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			e.) The User understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including CryptovationX, assigned to this task
			will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the CryptovationX Platform, it is possible that such development
			may fail and User’s CXA become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons
			(see also Section 5 regarding Risks).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			f.) Depending on the popularity of the Initial Coin Offering, it cannot be guaranteed that the User’s BTC or ETH shall be
			included in the Initial Coin Offering or that the User will receive CXA. Any BTC or ETH transferred that do not entitle
			the User to CXA will be automatically directed back to the sending address.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			g.) The User understands and accepts the risk that even if all or parts of the CryptovationX Platform are successfully developed
			and released in full or in parts, the CryptovationX Platform could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially
			unsuccessful or be shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons. The User therefore understands and accepts
			that the Contribution of BTC or ETH, the creation of CXA by the Smart Contract System and the Smart Contract System allocation
			of CXA carry significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value of CXA
			(if any), and attributed features of the CryptovationX Platform).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			h.) The User furthermore1 understands and accepts that the final allocation of the CXA as well as the assignment of the execution
			of the CryptovationX Platform are smart-contract based. Consequently, the Smart Contract System contains code which sets
			forth further terms and conditions applicable to the distribution and operation of the CXA and the CryptovationX Platform
			(as defined in paragraph l) (such code, the Smart Contract System Code). The direct address(es) of the Smart Contract
			System on the Ethereum blockchain is provided on the CryptovationX Platform website. The terms and conditions set forth
			in the Smart Contract System Code are incorporated by this reference and constitute part of these Terms & Conditions.
			To the extent the terms contained herein or in any other document or communication contradict the ones set forth in the
			Smart Contract System, the terms of the Smart Contract System shall prevail. Access to the CryptovationX Platform and
			the functionality of the CXA is defined by the Smart Contract System only. Furthermore1, neither this document nor any
			other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations to CryptovationX or publisher of these terms
			or developer of the Smart Contract System and/or any other person, CryptovationX and/or affiliates involved with the deployment
			of the Smart Contract System and the setting up of the CryptovationX Platform beyond those set forth in the Smart Contract
			System.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			i.) By making the Contribution, the User expressly agrees to all of the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms & Conditions,
			including the Smart Contract System Code. The User further confirms having carefully reviewed the Terms & Conditions in
			full, and the User further undertakes to review the Smart Contract System Code and its functions once released, and to
			fully understand the risks and costs associated with the allocation and holding of CXA and contributing into a Smart Contract
			System.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			j.) This document and any other materials provided by CryptovationX or relating to the CryptovationX Platform do not constitute
			a prospectus of any sort, are not a solicitation for investment and do not pertain in any way to an offering of securities
			in any jurisdiction. Neither this document nor any other materials have been (or will be) registered as a prospectus with
			any governmental authorities.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			k.) Transfer of either BTC or ETH, allocation, distribution or receipt of CryptovationX, or any other act undertaken between
			the parties in connection with the Pre-sale or the Initial Coin Offering shall not form a partnership, joint venture or
			any similar relationship between the User and CryptovationX and/or other individuals or entities involved with the deployment
			of the Smart Contract System and the setting up of the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			l.) The User acknowledges and understands that CryptovationX may at its discretion at any time change the name of the CryptovationX
			token and/or its symbol. CryptovationX shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that such change of name and/or symbol
			will not adversely affect the rights of the Users or the CXA held by the Users.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			2.) CryptovationX Creation
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.1.) Usage Token; No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) Usage Token: Ownership of CXA carries no rights express or implied other than a limited right to use CXA as a means to
			enable usage of and interaction with and within the CryptovationX Platform (the CryptovationX Platform), if and to the
			extent the CryptovationX Platform has been successfully completed and launched.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights: In particular, the User understands and accepts that CXA do not represent
			or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues,
			shares or any other form of participation or governance right in or relating to the CryptovationX Platform and/or CryptovationX.
			CryptovationX does not create or confer any enforceable contractual or other obligations against any third party (including
			CryptovationX, CryptovationX Team Members (as defined below) or other developers, auditors, contractors or founders associated
			with CryptovationX, the CryptovationX Platform and/or CryptovationX).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.2.) Contribution
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) User Registration: Each User who intends to participate in the Initial Coin Offering must complete a registration process
			before being able to participate. The registration process details will be set out on the CryptovationX Platform website.
			Upon completion of the registration and approval thereof, the User’s Ethereum address will be whitelisted in the Smart
			Contract System. The User acknowledges and understands that the registration process is laborious and it may take time
			to process the User’s registration.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) Maximum Contribution Amount: The aggregate maximum Contribution amount for the entire allocation of CXA pursuant to the
			Initial Coin Offering, (but excluding the Pre-sale as well as contributions from private entities and individuals of strategic
			value for the CryptovationX Platform) will be defined as a hard cap and amounts to an amount of BTC and/or ETH equivalent
			to 21,600,000 USD (excluding fees arising from or related to the contribution process), calculated using the exchange
			rates as determined by reference to publicly available pricing data within six (6) hours prior to consummation of the
			Initial Coin Offering (the Maximum Contribution Amount). CryptovationX may, at its discretion, determine that the Maximum
			Contribution Amount is reached when the aggregate amount of Funds transferred to the Smart Contract System is close to
			the Maximum Contribution Amount, even though the actual amount of Contributions accepted by the Smart Contract System
			would be less than the Maximum Contribution Amount (e.g. if the aggregate amount of Contributions does not sum up to exactly
			the Maximum Contribution Amount).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			c.) Maximum CryptovationX Token Supply: The aggregate maximum CryptovationX token supply for Pool A (as set out in paragraph
			(f)) will be 7,200,000,000 CXA. The aggregate amount of CXA will depend on the effectively made Contributions during the
			Initial Coin Offering
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			d.) Contribution Period: The Initial Coin Offering period (Initial Coin Offering Period) starts on the date and time set
			to be announced on the CryptovationX Platform website and continues for a period of four (4) weeks or the moment when
			the Maximum Contribution Amount has been reached, whichever occurs earlier.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			e.) Contribution and Exchange Rates: The contribution rate in the Initial Coin Offering shall be 1 CryptovationX for every
			Contribution equivalent to $0.003 USD. The BTC/USD and ETH/USD exchange rates to be used throughout the Initial Coin Offering
			shall be fixed by CryptovationX six (6) hours before the commencement of the Initial Coin Offering Period.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			f.) Token Pools: The allocation of CXA will be determined as set out below. The Users making Contributions in the Initial
			Coin Offering will be distributed CXA from Pool A. The aggregate amount of CXA that will be distributed from Pool A at
			the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period will depend on the aggregate size of the Contributions.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(1) Pool A consists of [7,200,000,000] CXA (i.e. 60% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool A is intended to be created by the Smart
			Contract System at the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period and ultimately distributed (directly or via third parties)
			to Users that have made Contributions in the Initial Coin Offering.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(2) Pool B consists of [540,000,000] CXA (i.e. 4.5% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool B is intended to be created by the Smart
			Contract System at the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period and ultimately distributed (directly or via third parties)
			to Users that have made Contributions in the Pre-sale.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(3) Pool C consists of [720,000,000] CXA (i.e. 6% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool C will be allocated to CryptovationX for
			distribution pursuant to Bounty, Airdrop, and Strategic Partnership programs. The effective distribution will be fully
			at the discretion of CryptovationX.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(4) Pool D consists of [1,140,000,000] CXA (i.e. 9.5% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool D will be allocated to the CryptovationX
			Foundation and distributed at the discretion of CryptovationX, such as allocation and distribution to persons who participated
			as managers, founders or team members, or worked to develop the ideas, implementations and supporting structures of the
			CryptovationX Platform (the CryptovationX Team Members).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(5) Pool E consists of [1,200,000,000] CXA (i.e. 10% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool E is intended to be created by the Smart
			Contract System at the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period and ultimately distributed to the CryptovationX Foundation.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(6) Pool F consists of [1,200,000,000] CXA (i.e. 10% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool F will be allocated to the CryptovationX
			Foundation for distribution pursuant to the Wealth for All program. The effective distribution will be fully at the discretion
			of CryptovationX.
		</p>

		<p class="more1">

			g.) Contribution Process: Upon commencement of the Initial Coin Offering Period, the registered, approved and whitelisted
			Users may transfer their BTC or ETH to the Smart Contract System at the address provided on the CryptovationX Platform
			Website. The User may not make a Contribution that is greater than his whitelisted amount. If the User sends a transaction
			that exceeds the limit, the transaction will fail and the BTC and ETH in that transaction are returned. The tokens in
			the Initial Coin Offering will be allocated among the Users making Contributions on a first come, first served basis.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			h.) Distribution of CXA to Users: Upon receipt and acceptance of a User’s Contribution, the Smart Contract System will allocate
			a corresponding amount of CXA to the User’s Ethereum address. The CXA will be nontransferable until they are released
			as set out in paragraph l).
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			i.) Undistributed tokens: Any CXA in Pool A that have been created but for which no Contribution has ultimately been received
			shall be allocated to CryptovationX and shall be further disposed of at CryptovationX’s discretion for purposes of the
			long-term benefit of the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			j.) No Refund: The User understands and accepts that all Contributions are final and may not be reversed. Contributions that
			entitle a User to CXA are non- refundable. Any Contributions that do not entitle the User to CXA (e.g. due to the amount
			of Contributions exceeding the Maximum Contribution Amount) will be automatically sent back to the sending address. By
			contributing to the CryptovationX Platform, the User acknowledges that he has no right to request a refund for any reason,
			and that the User will not receive money or other compensation for any CryptovationX that is not used or remains unused.
			CryptovationX shall not be liable for any losses caused by the User attempting to make a Contribution from an exchange,
			smart contract or other non- standard single access address.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			k.) Ensure the use of the original Smart Contract System: Only the Smart Contract System(s) will allocate CXA. To the extent
			that any third-party website, service or smart-contract offers CXA during the Initial Coin Offering Period or facilitates
			the allocation or transfer of CXA in any way during the Initial Coin Offering Period, such third-party websites or services
			are, unless explicitly mentioned in these Terms & Conditions, not authorized by CryptovationX and have no relationship
			in any way with CryptovationX.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			l.) Transferability of CXA: The Users will not be able to transfer CXA until the CXA have been released. CryptovationX transferability
			will be released at CryptovationX’s discretion when the Initial Coin Offering Period is over and all CXA (including the
			CXA from the Pre-sale) have been allocated and distributed; the process is currently expected to take a few weeks after
			the conclusion of the Initial Coin Offering Period. The CXA in Pools D, E and F shall become transferable at such time
			as determined by CryptovationX in its full discretion.
		</p>
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.3.) Pre-Allocation of CryptovationX

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) The User understands and accepts that at least 40% of CXA will not be allocated to participants of the Initial Coin Offering
			but as set forth below:

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(1) Pool B consists of [540,000,000] CXA (i.e. 4.5% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool B is intended to be created by the Smart
			Contract System at the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period and ultimately distributed (directly or via third parties)
			to Users that have made Contributions in the Pre-sale.

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(2) Pool C consists of [720,000,000] CXA (i.e. 6% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool C will be allocated to CryptovationX for
			distribution pursuant to Bounty, Airdrop, and Strategic Partnership programs. The effective distribution will be fully
			at the discretion of CryptovationX.

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(3) Pool D consists of [1,140,000,000] CXA (i.e. 9.5% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool D will be allocated to the CryptovationX
			Foundation and distributed at the discretion of CryptovationX, such as allocation and distribution to persons who participated
			as managers, founders or team members, or worked to develop the ideas, implementations and supporting structures of the
			CryptovationX Platform (the CryptovationX Team Members).

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(4) Pool E consists of [1,200,000,000] CXA (i.e. 10% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool E is intended to be created by the Smart
			Contract System at the end of the Initial Coin Offering Period and ultimately distributed to the CryptovationX Foundation.

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(5) Pool F consists of [1,200,000,000] CXA (i.e. 10% of the Total CXA Supply). Pool F will be allocated to the CryptovationX
			Foundation for distribution pursuant to the Wealth for All program. The effective distribution will be fully at the discretion
			of CryptovationX..



		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.4.) CXA Functionality

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) CXA is only for use in connection with the CryptovationX Platform under the terms of the Smart Contract System and only
			constitutes a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the Smart Contract System.

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) CXA is a usage token which enables users to participate on the CryptovationX Platform. In practice, CryptovationX acts
			as a settlement token on the CryptovationX Platform whereby Users must pay transactional fees in CXA in order to make
			use of services offered by the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			c.) Ownership of a CXA carries no rights express or implied other than the right to use CXA as a means to enable usage of
			and interaction with and within the CryptovationX Platform, if successfully completed and deployed (see Section 3). Beyond
			this, ownership of a CXA carries no rights express or implied. In particular, the User understands and accepts that as
			a holder of CXA, he has no right to claim any ownership right or stake, intellectual property rights, equity or equivalent
			rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the CryptovationX Platform and/or CryptovationX. Through the
			allocation of CXA to a User, the User receives no right to receive any revenues generated by the intellectual property
			rights developed as part of the CryptovationX Platform or any other assets. The User understands and agrees that the sole
			and exclusive usage rights of these intellectual property rights are retained by CryptovationX and/or its affiliates.


		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			2.5.) Representations and Warranties of User

		<p class="more1">
			a.) By making the Contribution, the User represents and warrants that:
		</p>

			in any jurisdiction;
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(19) the User understands that the Contribution, the allocation and distribution of CXA and the development of the CryptovationX
			Platform carries significant financial, regulatory and reputational risks as further set forth in Section 5;
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			(20) THE USER UNDERSTANDS AND EXPRESSLY ACCEPTS THAT THERE IS NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER ON THE CXA, THE SMART CONTRACT SYSTEM

		<p class="more1">
			(21) the User understands that the User has no right against any other party to request any refund of the Contribution for

		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(22) the User understands that with regard to CryptovationX, no market liquidity (including the existence of a marketplace
			where CXA can be transferred) may be guaranteed and the value of CryptovationX may over time experience extreme volatility
			or depreciate in full;
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(23) the User understands that the User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the User’s transfer of Funds, the creation,
			allocation, ownership or use of CryptovationX, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of CryptovationX
			over time and/or any other action or transaction related to the CryptovationX Platform have tax implications for him;
			by receiving, holding, transferring or using CryptovationX, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the User agrees
			not to hold any third party (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any tax liability associated
			with or arising from the distribution, allocation, ownership or use of CXA or any other action or transaction related
			to the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">

			b.)As part of the CryptovationX allocation process, the User will use his own address on the Ethereum network, with a private
			key associated to this address and password. The password is used to protect the access to the use of the User’s private
			key. Following the creation of CXA in Pool A by the Smart Contract System, in consideration for User’s participation in
			the Initial Coin Offering, the CXA will be transferred to the address from which the Contribution was made. In order to
			receive the CXA, the User shall ensure that he supplies his own Ethereum address and not, e.g., the address of a currency
			exchange like Poloniex, Coinbase, Bitfinex etc. The User understands that the User must keep his password and private
			key safe and that the User may not share them with anybody. The User further understands that if his private key, password
			and/or back-up seed is lost or stolen, the User may not be able to generate a new password or recover his private key,
			and if the User also loses his private keys and password, the CXA associated with the User's account (address) will be
			unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Furthermore1, the User understands that there may be no recovery mechanism
			for lost keys, passwords and/or back-up seeds, so no one may be able to provide the User with access to any CryptovationX
			on accounts whose private key, password and/or back-up seed has been lost.
		</p>


		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			3.) CryptovationX Platform Operation
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) The User understands and accepts that the development and operation of the CryptovationX Platform will be performed by
			CryptovationX. For these purposes, CryptovationX shall be entitled to the full amount of the Contribution (less costs)
			and may transfer and allocate such funds as necessary. These amounts cover expenses, charges and other costs that may
			arise by CryptovationX as part of the development and execution of the CryptovationX Platform. CryptovationX has the right
			to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial development and execution of the CryptovationX Platform. The
			scope of the development work will be triggered by the aggregate amount of Contributions received, as indicatively laid
			out in the Whitepaper; provided, however, that CryptovationX shall have full discretion to determine the scope of development
			work. It remains at CryptovationX’s sole discretion to decide how to allocate the funds in order to develop and execute
			the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) The User understands and accepts that the User may not have any expectation of influence over governance on the CryptovationX
			Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			c.) The User understands and accepts that the CryptovationX Platform will need to go through substantial development work
			which may result in significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. The User understands and
			accepts that as part of the development, an upgrade of CryptovationX token may be required (a so-called hard-fork of CryptovationX
			token) and that, if the User decides not to participate in such upgrade, he may no longer use his CXA and that any non-upgraded
			CXA may lose their functionality in full.
		</p>

		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			4.) Audit of the Smart Contract System
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) The Smart Contract System has been, on a reasonable effort basis, audited and approved by a technical expert. The technical
			expert has confirmed that the Smart Contract System has, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according
			to the current state of the art.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			b.) However, the User understands and accepts that smart-contract technology is still in an early development stage and its
			application of experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational
			risks. Accordingly, while the audit conducted raises the level of security and accuracy, the User understands and accepts
			that the audit does not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract
			System and/or CXA are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could
			cause, inter alia, the complete loss of Funds and/or CXA.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="more2">
			5.) Risks
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			a.) The User understands and accepts the risks associated with the Contribution, the Smart Contract System, the creation
			of CXA and the distribution of CXA, in each case, including but not limited to those that are set forth above and hereinafter.
			In particular, the User understands and accepts the non-exhaustive list of inherent risks:
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(1) Risk of software weaknesses: The underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain)
			are still in an early development stage and unproven, and there are no warranties or covenants that the process for creating
			or distributing CXA will be uninterrupted or error-free; there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses,
			vulnerabilities or bugs that could result in, inter alia, the complete loss of Funds and/or CXA.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(2) Risk of cryptographic weaknesses: The Ethereum blockchain and all software dependent thereon, such as the CryptovationX
			Platform and CryptovationX are based on the effectiveness and reliability of cryptographic solutions. However, cryptography
			is evolving and cannot guarantee absolute security at all times. Advances in cryptography, such as code cracking, or technical
			advances, such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to all cryptography-based systems including
			the CryptovationX Platform and CXA. This could result in the theft, loss, disappearance, destruction or devaluation of
			the CXA held by the User.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(3) Regulatory risk: Blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions
			will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain-technology-based applications,
			which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial
			modifications of the Smart Contract System and/or the CryptovationX Platform, including its termination and the loss or
			devaluation of CXA held by the User.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(4) Risk of insufficient information: The CryptovationX Platform is at a very early developmental stage and its philosophy,
			consensus mechanism, algorithm, code and other technical specifications and parameters could be updated and changed frequently
			and con- stantly. While the Whitepaper contains the up-to-date key information related to CXA at the date of the Whitepaper,
			it is not complete or final and is subject to adjustments and updates that CryptovationX may make from time to time. CryptovationX
			is not in a position, nor obligated, to keep the Users closely posted on every detail of the CryptovationX Platform’s
			development (including its progress and expected milestones, whether rescheduled or not) and therefore will not necessarily
			provide the Users with timely or full access to all the information relating to the CryptovationX Platform that may emerge
			from time to time.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(5) Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The creation and distribution of the CXA and the development of the CryptovationX
			Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of
			commercial success or lack of prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). CXA is not expected to be popular, prevalent
			or widely used soon after its launch. CXA and the CryptovationX Platform may remain marginalized in the long run, appealing
			to only a minimal portion of users (if any). There is thus no assurance that, even if the CryptovationX Platform is partially
			or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through CXA held by him.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(6) Risks related to unverified source code: The source code of the CryptovationX Platform may be licensed under open-source
			license terms and any party related or unrelated to the CryptovationX Platform can propose updates, amendments, alterations
			or modifications to the source code. CryptovationX may not be able to verify or guarantee the results of such updates,
			amendments, alterations or modifications, and as a result, any update, amendment, alteration or modification could lead
			to an unexpected or unintended outcome that adversely affects the CryptovationX Platform or CXA value.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(7) Risks related to competition: The source code of the CryptovationX Platform may be licensed under open-source license
			terms. As a result, other persons may be able to copy, replicate, reproduce, engineer, modify, improve or otherwise utilize
			the source code and/or underlying source code of the CryptovationX Platform in an attempt to develop a competing protocol,
			software, system or virtual platform or virtual machine, which is out of CryptovationX’s control and may consequently
			compete with or even overshadow or overtake the CryptovationX Platform, which may adversely affect the CryptovationX Platform
			or CXA value.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(8) Risk of withdrawing partners: The feasibility of the CryptovationX Platform depends strongly on the collaboration of
			banks and other crucial partners of CryptovationX. There is therefore no assurance that the CryptovationX Platform as
			a whole or parts thereof will be successfully executed as set out in these Terms & Conditions or otherwise.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(9) Risk associated with other applications: The CryptovationX Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted
			by unaffiliated third parties, under which CXA will have no intrinsic value. [I don’t think I understand this part]
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(10) Risk of loss of private key: CXA can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the User’s account
			information (address), private key, password and any other protection used by the User. If the User’s private key file,
			password or the back-up seed is lost or stolen, the CXA associated with the User's account (address) or password may be
			unrecoverable and permanently lost. [duplicative of 2.5(b) above]
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(11) Third party risk: CryptovationX may engage third parties to manage and operate the Pre-sale and Initial Coin Offering
			processes. CryptovationX has no ability to monitor or control, the software or mechanisms used by such third parties and
			cannot verify or guarantee the proper functionality of such third parties’ software or operations.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(12) Risk of theft: The Smart Contract System, the Smart Contract System Code, the underlying software application and software
			platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain), or other assets of the CryptovationX Platform, may be exposed to attacks by hackers
			or other individuals that could result in theft or loss of CXA or Funds, which may lead to a loss or devaluation of Funds
			and/or CXA and the ability to develop the CryptovationX Platform.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(13) Risk of Ethereum mining and other malicious attacks: As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart
			Contract System is susceptible to mining and other malicious attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
			majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attack presents a
			risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of CXA transactions, and expected proper execution
			and sequencing of contract computations.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(14) Risk of changes in Smart Contract System: The network of miners (or, in the future, potentially a network of staking
			nodes [possible securities issue]) will be ultimately in control of the Smart Contract System. A majority of these miners
			could agree at any point to make changes to the Smart Contract System and to run the new version of the Smart Contract
			System, which could lead to reduced functionality of the CryptovationX Platform and/or devaluation of CXA.
		</p>
		<p class="more1">
			(15) Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The cryptographic wallet software or wallet service provider of the User must be
			technically compatible with CXA. The failure to assure this may lead to the User being unable to gain access to his CXA.
